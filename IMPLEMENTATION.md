# Porter - Implementation Summary

## Phase 1: Core Essentials (MVP) ✅ COMPLETED

### What We've Built

#### 1. **Backend (Rust/Tauri)**
- ✅ Cross-platform port scanning (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- ✅ Platform-specific implementations for network connection detection
- ✅ Process information gathering (PID, name, path, CPU, memory)
- ✅ Process killing functionality with graceful termination
- ✅ Common developer ports scanner (3000, 8080, 5173, etc.)
- ✅ Tauri IPC commands for frontend communication

**Key Files Created:**
- `src-tauri/src/models/port.rs` - Data models
- `src-tauri/src/platform/windows.rs` - Windows network scanning
- `src-tauri/src/platform/linux.rs` - Linux network scanning
- `src-tauri/src/platform/macos.rs` - macOS network scanning
- `src-tauri/src/services/port_monitor.rs` - Port monitoring service
- `src-tauri/src/services/process_manager.rs` - Process management
- `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` - Tauri commands

#### 2. **Frontend (React + TypeScript)**
- ✅ Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Dark/Light mode toggle with persistence
- ✅ Port grid displaying common developer ports
- ✅ Real-time port status (Free/Occupied/System)
- ✅ Search functionality to filter ports
- ✅ Port detail modal with full process information
- ✅ Kill process functionality with confirmation
- ✅ Quick stats dashboard (free/occupied/system counts)
- ✅ Auto-refresh every 2 seconds

**Key Components:**
- `src/components/dashboard/Header.tsx` - App header with theme toggle
- `src/components/dashboard/PortCard.tsx` - Individual port card
- `src/components/dashboard/PortGrid.tsx` - Grid layout for ports
- `src/components/dashboard/SearchBar.tsx` - Search input
- `src/components/dashboard/PortDetailModal.tsx` - Detailed port/process view
- `src/App.tsx` - Main application component

#### 3. **State Management & Data Fetching**
- ✅ Zustand for theme management
- ✅ TanStack Query (React Query) for data fetching & caching
- ✅ Custom hooks for port monitoring
- ✅ Automatic background refresh

#### 4. **Styling & Design**
- ✅ Tailwind CSS with custom theme
- ✅ CSS variables for dark/light mode
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Clean, modern UI components
- ✅ Color-coded port status (green/red/yellow)

### How to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run tauri:dev

# Build for production
npm run tauri:build
```

**Note**: The app is currently running successfully in development mode!

### Features Implemented

1. **Port Monitoring**
   - Scans common developer ports on startup
   - Real-time status updates
   - Shows process information for occupied ports
   - Distinguishes between user and system processes

2. **Search & Filter**
   - Search by port number
   - Search by process name
   - Search by status

3. **Process Management**
   - View detailed process information
   - Kill processes safely
   - Graceful termination with fallback to force kill

4. **User Experience**
   - Dark/Light mode with persistence
   - Quick stats overview
   - Clean, intuitive interface
   - Fast and responsive

### Next Steps: Phase 2 (Future Enhancement)

When ready to implement Phase 2:

1. **Real-time Monitoring Enhancements**
   - Adjustable refresh intervals
   - Pause/resume monitoring
   - Activity notifications

2. **Port Favorites**
   - Save frequently checked ports
   - Quick access to favorite ports
   - Custom port collections

3. **System Tray Integration**
   - Minimize to system tray
   - Quick access from tray
   - Tray notifications

4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Ctrl/Cmd+F for search
   - Ctrl/Cmd+R for refresh
   - ESC to close modals

### Architecture Highlights

- **Type-safe**: End-to-end TypeScript + Rust
- **Cross-platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux support
- **Lightweight**: ~3-5MB bundle size (vs 85MB+ for Electron)
- **Fast**: Native performance through Rust
- **Secure**: Tauri security model, safe process management
- **Modern**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS

### Testing

To test the application:
1. Run `npm run tauri:dev`
2. Check if common ports are displayed
3. Start a dev server on port 3000 (e.g., `npx serve -p 3000`)
4. Verify the port shows as "Occupied"
5. Click on the port to see details
6. Test the kill process functionality
7. Toggle dark/light mode
8. Test the search functionality

**Status**: Phase 1 MVP Complete ✅
**Ready for**: Testing and Phase 2 planning
